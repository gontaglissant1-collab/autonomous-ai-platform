# ðŸ‘‹ OpenManus

Manus is incredible, but OpenManus can achieve any idea without an _Invite Code_ ðŸ›«!

Our team members [@Xinbin Liang]() and [@Jinyu Xiang]() (core authors), along with [@Zhaoyang Yu](), [@Jiayi Zhang](), and [@Sirui Hong](), we are from [@MetaGPT](). The prototype is launched within 3 hours and we are keeping building!

It's a simple implementation, so we welcome any suggestions, contributions, and feedback!

Enjoy your own agent with OpenManus!

We're also excited to introduce [OpenManus-RL](), an open-source project dedicated to reinforcement learning (RL)- based (such as GRPO) tuning methods for LLM agents, developed collaboratively by researchers from UIUC and OpenManus.

## Project Demo

## Installation

We provide two installation methods. Method 2 (using uv) is recommended for faster installation and better dependency management.

### Method 1: Using conda

1.  Create a new conda environment:

```shell
conda create -n open_manus python=3.12
conda activate open_manus
```

2.  Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/FoundationAgents/OpenManus.git
cd OpenManus
```

3.  Install dependencies:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Method 2: Using uv (Recommended)

1.  Install uv (A fast Python package installer and resolver):

```shell
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2.  Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/FoundationAgents/OpenManus.git
cd OpenManus
```

3.  Create a new virtual environment and activate it:

```shell
uv venv --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
# Or on Windows:
# .venv\Scripts\activate
```

4.  Install dependencies:

```shell
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Browser Automation Tool (Optional)

```shell
playwright install
```

## Configuration

OpenManus requires configuration for the LLM APIs it uses. Follow these steps to set up your configuration:

1.  Create a `config.toml` file in the `config` directory (you can copy from the example):

```shell
cp config/config.example.toml config/config.toml
```

2.  Edit `config/config.toml` to add your API keys and customize settings:

```toml
# Global LLM configuration
[llm]
model = "gpt-4o"
base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
api_key = "sk-..."  # Replace with your actual API key
max_tokens = 4096
temperature = 0.0

# Optional configuration for specific LLM models
[llm.vision]
model = "gpt-4o"
base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
api_key = "sk-..."  # Replace with your actual API key
```

## Quick Start

One line for run OpenManus:

```shell
python main.py
```

Then input your idea via terminal!

For MCP tool version, you can run:

```shell
python run_mcp.py
```

For unstable multi-agent version, you also can run:

```shell
python run_flow.py
```

### Custom Adding Multiple Agents

Currently, besides the general OpenManus Agent, we have also integrated the DataAnalysis Agent, which is suitable for data analysis and data visualization tasks. You can add this agent to `run_flow` in `config.toml`.

```toml
# Optional configuration for run-flow
[runflow]
use_data_analysis_agent = true     # Disabled by default, change to true to activate
```

In addition, you need to install the relevant dependencies to ensure the agent runs properly: [Detailed Installation Guide]()
